  # ANTIGRAVITY OBSERVER
  **Enterprise-Grade Mission Control for Autonomous Agent Operations**
</div>

---

## Executive Summary

Antigravity Observer is a specialized observation and orchestration platform designed for real-time monitoring of agentic workflows. By providing deep-stream visibility into token consumption, security integrity, and predictive performance, it empowers developers to govern local autonomous systems with unparalleled precision.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Reactive Mission Intelligence
* **Dynamic Event Stream**: Real-time throughput monitoring via a centralized EventBus architecture.
* **Predictive Bottleneck Analysis**: Heuristic-based forecasting of system latency and resource constraints.
* **Token ROI Monitoring**: Granular tracking of model costs with automated threshold alerts.

### 2. Autonomous Governance & Security
* **Moral Security Layer**: Integrated pattern matching for PII and credential leak prevention.
* **Ethical Guardrails**: Real-time validation against agent interaction policies.
* **Cryptographic Integrity**: Verification of workspace synchronizations and artifact generation.

### 3. Extensible Plugin Registry
* Standardized interface for integrating third-party orchestration services.
* Decoupled architecture allowing for "hot-swappable" monitoring modules.

## Architecture Guidelines

The system is built upon a high-performance, low-latency JavaScript core optimized for Chrome's Manifest V3 standard. It utilizes a reactive state management pattern to ensure UI synchronization without blocking mission-critical agent threads.

## Implementation & Deployment

### Local Environment Setup
1. Clone the repository to a secure directory.
2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions` in a Chromium-based browser.
3. Enable **Developer Mode**.
4. Select **Load unpacked** and point to the project root.

### Verification Flow
Execution status can be verified through the **Mission Control Log** (MCL) available in the extension's primary viewport.
